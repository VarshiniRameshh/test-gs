Could you please confirm if there is an automated key rotation process in place, or if it is currently being overseen manually by the Application Team?

May I check whether the logging configurations are complete and properly integrated with downstream systems such as PAR and Surveillance?

Is the current monitoring setup fully established and integrated with GS monitoring tools, or are there any known gaps?

Could you clarify whether the data sensitivity levels have been accurately classified, or if there have been instances of misclassification?
