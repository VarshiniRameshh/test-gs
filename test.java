Establish an awareness, education, and training programme aligned with security policies and procedures, including controls implemented to protect information.

Conduct awareness and training periodically, and for new personnel or role changes.

Assess understanding post-training to measure effectiveness.

Awareness programmes should:

Make personnel aware of their responsibilities and how to fulfil them.

Be planned considering all types of personnel (internal, external, suppliers).

Include repeated and varied activities (e.g. campaigns, posters, newsletters, e-learning).

Cover topics like management commitment, legal and policy compliance, personal accountability, security procedures, incident reporting, and resources for further learning.

Education and training programmes should:

Address technical teamsâ€™ specific skill requirements to maintain security levels.

Use varied delivery methods (lectures, self-studies, mentoring, on-the-job training, external consultants, conferences, online modules).

Ensure technical staff keep knowledge up to date and acquire missing skills as needed.
