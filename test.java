Organizations must regularly review compliance with their information security policy, topic-specific policies, rules, and applicable standards to ensure effective implementation and alignment with business objectives.

Managers or designated personnel should verify that defined security controls are followed, using tools and reports where feasible. When non-compliance is identified, it must trigger a formal process including:

Identifying root causes

Implementing corrective actions

Reviewing their effectiveness

All findings and actions must be documented, maintained, and reported to appropriate stakeholders, including external reviewers when required. Corrective actions should be completed within risk-based timelines. If delayed, progress should be tracked and reassessed during follow-ups.
