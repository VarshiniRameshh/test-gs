Organizations must establish and maintain documented operating procedures for information processing facilities to ensure secure, consistent, and efficient operations. These procedures must be accessible to authorized personnel and reviewed regularly for accuracy.

Documentation is especially important when:

Tasks are repeated by different individuals

Procedures are infrequent and easily forgotten

Execution errors could introduce security risks

Responsibilities are being transferred to new staff

Documents should include details on:

Assigned roles and responsibilities

Secure installation and configuration of systems

Manual and automated data handling

Backup and resilience procedures (refer to A.8.13)

Process scheduling and interdependencies

Handling of errors and exceptional conditions (see A.8.18)

Escalation paths and support contacts

Storage media handling (see A.7.10, A.7.14)

System restart/recovery plans

Log and audit trail management (see A.8.15, A.8.17) and video monitoring (see A.7.4)

Monitoring routines (see A.8.6, A.8.16)

Maintenance protocols

All procedures should be formally approved and consistently applied across teams and systems.
