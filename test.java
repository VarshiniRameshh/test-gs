Sure! Here's the **formal checklist in plain text format** without the table, just like you'd note it down or send to Rony:

### ✅ Final Documentation Change Checklist (Plain Format)

1. **Add Port Validation to Case A**
   – Add the following as **point 3** under Case A:
   *“Ports allowed are within 1024–65535.”*

2. **Clarify That All Conditions in Case A Must Be Met**
   – Add this sentence **above the conditions** in Case A:
   *“Approve only if all of the following conditions are met:”*

3. **Refine the Terminology in Case A (Point 2)**
   – Update point 2 under Case A to be more precise. Suggested version:
   *“All sources are either non-prod DIDs, NDS, or collections that only contain non-prod assets.”*

4. **Clarify That the Pattern Page Applies to Production**
   – Add a note (at the top or near scope definition) like:
   *“This pattern applies to production Atlas setups only. Any non-prod exceptions must be separately documented.”*

5. **Review Case B to Avoid Duplication**
   – Check if any of the 6 conditions in Case B are already covered or enforced elsewhere (e.g., by tooling or policy).
   – If they are, add a clarifying note next to that line saying:
   *“(Already enforced via \[platform/tool/process])”*

6. **Add a Note on DP/Privacy Classification Parity**
   – In the section about classification mismatches (points 4 and 5 under manual review), mention:
   *“This control is not currently enforced via tooling and must be verified manually during review.”*

7. **Clean Up the Questions for Kishore**
   – Cross-check all drafted questions.
   – Remove anything that is already explained in the current pattern documentation.
   – Keep only questions that are truly gaps or need clarification.

8. **Confirm Whether Cross-RIM Access Is Enforced**
   – Validate whether cross-region/realm access (RIM) is blocked in current implementation.
   – If it’s not, add a sentence in the relevant control:
   *“Cross-RIM connectivity is not currently enforced and must be reviewed manually on a case-by-case basis.”*

Let me know if you want help rewriting the updated **Case A and B** sections with all these incorporated.
