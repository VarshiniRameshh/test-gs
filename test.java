Employment contracts should include personnel and organizational responsibilities for information security.

Ensure inclusion of:

Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements before granting access to confidential data or assets.

Legal responsibilities and rights (e.g. data protection, copyright laws).

Responsibilities for classifying and managing information and processing facilities.

Handling of information received from external parties.

Disciplinary actions for non-compliance with security requirements.

Communicate security roles and responsibilities during pre-employment.

Terms should align with security policies and be updated upon legal, regulatory, or policy changes.

A code of conduct should define expected security behaviours, ethical use, and PII protection.

Suppliers with personnel accessing organizational information should also have similar contractual agreements.
