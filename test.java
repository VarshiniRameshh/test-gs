Organizations must conduct independent reviews of their information security approach, including people, processes, and technology, to ensure its ongoing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

Periodic reviews should be planned and initiated by management, focusing on identifying improvements and necessary changes aligned with security policies and specific controls. Reviews must be conducted by individuals or entities independent of the area being assessed, such as internal audit teams or external specialists, and findings should be reported to management with appropriate documentation maintained.

If reviews identify inadequacies (e.g., unclear objectives, non-compliance with policies), corrective actions must be initiated.

Reviews should also be conducted during significant events such as:

* Changes in applicable laws or regulations
* Security incidents
* Launch of new business models or services
* Updates to current products or services
* Modifications in the organization’s security controls or procedures

These steps help maintain compliance and ensure continual improvement of the organization’s information security posture.
