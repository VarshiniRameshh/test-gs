Organizations must identify, document, and protect intellectual property rights (IPR), including copyrights, trademarks, patents, and software licenses. Responsibilities for managing IP should be clearly defined, with proper controls in place to prevent unauthorized use or distribution of protected materials.

Use of software, digital media, and other copyrighted content must follow licensing terms, and periodic reviews should ensure compliance. Contracts with employees, suppliers, and third parties should specify ownership and usage rights for created or shared IP.

Training and awareness programs should be conducted to ensure staff understand IPR obligations, including the use of open-source or third-party content. Legal advice may be necessary in complex or cross-border IP matters.
