Define and enforce security responsibilities that remain valid after termination or job changes (e.g. confidentiality, intellectual property, knowledge retention).
Ensure these responsibilities are included in employment contracts and continue post-employment where needed.
Manage changes in responsibility as part of role changes or termination processes, identifying and transferring security roles and duties to other individuals.
Establish communication procedures for operational changes to personnel, relevant parties, and contacts (e.g. customers, suppliers).
Apply termination/change processes to employees and suppliers alike.


Identify, document, review, and sign confidentiality or NDA agreements to protect organizational information.
Agreements should cover:
Definition and classification of protected information
Duration of confidentiality, including indefinite if required
Required actions upon agreement termination
Responsibilities to avoid disclosure
Ownership of information, trade secrets, and IP
Permitted use and rights of signatories
Right to audit and monitor activities
Process for reporting unauthorized disclosures or leaks
Consequences for non-compliance
Review agreements periodically to ensure continued relevance and legal compliance.
