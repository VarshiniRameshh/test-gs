I am reaching out to seek your assistance regarding the MyRisk portal. I am currently trying to retrieve details of tasks completed by a specific individual in a particular year, with a focus on design review activities. However, when I attempted to export the data, it only returned a limited subset of information.

Would it be possible for you to help me with this, or kindly direct me to someone who is responsible and could assist further?
