Organizations must ensure ICT readiness for business continuity by:

Planning, implementing, testing, and maintaining ICT continuity strategies based on business impact analysis (BIA) and risk assessments.

Ensuring ICT services meet recovery objectives (RTO/RPO) during disruptions.

Having a competent organizational structure, approved continuity plans, and capacity specifications.

Including ICT systems in business continuity strategies to support critical services.

This ensures availability and resilience of ICT services during failures or disruptions.
