Request for Clarification on MongoDB Atlas Risk & Approval

I hope this message finds you well.

I am Varshini Ramesh from the Tech Risk team, part of Manjari's team. I wanted to clarify a couple of items with you regarding MongoDB Atlas:

Are there any open risks associated with MongoDB Atlas?

Has this been approved by the vendor Tech Risk team?

Could you kindly confirm and share the details over email so your team can send the necessary information?

Looking forward to your response
