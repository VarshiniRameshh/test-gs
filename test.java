I hope you're doing well.

I understand you had previously suggested setting up a call regarding MyCollab. I wanted to follow up and let you know that I’ve completed a comparison between MyCollab and OneDrive, focusing on entitlements. I’d appreciate it if you could review the findings with me to confirm their accuracy.

Kindly let me know a convenient day and time based on your calendar, and I’ll arrange the call accordingly.
