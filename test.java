The R&D labs mentioned here are basically non-production setups used by engineering or analytics teams for things like testing, experimenting, or trying out new features — kind of like a sandbox. These environments aren’t meant to directly connect to production systems, which is why that access is blocked by default.

If there’s ever a need to connect from non-prod to prod, it has to go through a special approval process. That way, the team can make sure there’s a solid reason for it and that all the right safeguards are in place.
