Organizations must ensure the preservation of privacy and protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in accordance with legal, regulatory, contractual, and business requirements, while maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Clear policies and procedures should be developed and communicated to all relevant stakeholders for handling and safeguarding PII. These should include role assignments, such as a privacy officer, to guide and oversee compliance efforts.

Organizations must define and enforce responsibilities for PII protection aligned with applicable legislation and regulations. Both technical and organizational controls must be implemented to ensure secure collection, processing, transmission, storage, and deletion of PII.

Global legal requirements may impose restrictions on PII processing and cross-border transfers. Compliance frameworks such as ISO/IEC 29100 and ISO/IEC 27701 provide guidance on privacy information management. Risk assessments like Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA), as outlined in ISO/IEC 29134, help identify and manage privacy risks effectively.
