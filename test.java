A defined scheme should be used to categorize and prioritize information security events. The responsible personnel must assess each event and decide whether it qualifies as a security incident. This decision should be based on its potential consequences and impact. All outcomes must be documented clearly for future reference and verification.

------
The organization should implement a documented incident response procedure and ensure it is communicated to all relevant parties. A qualified response team must handle incidents promptly. Response actions should include:

Containing the impact
Collecting evidence
Escalating when necessary (e.g., crisis management, invoking BCP)
Logging all actions
Communicating incident details on a need-to-know basis
Coordinating with internal/external stakeholders
Performing root cause analysis and forensic investigations
Closing the incident formally
Reviewing and improving based on lessons learned
