Organizations should define procedures to identify, collect, acquire, and preserve evidence related to security events. Procedures must ensure:

Evidence is admissible and reliable for legal or disciplinary use.

Jurisdiction-specific legal standards are considered.

Records are complete, unaltered, and collected from valid systems.

Copies are identical to originals.

Certification or qualifications of personnel/tools strengthen evidence integrity.

Digital evidence handling must be carefully planned, especially when legal action is expected.
