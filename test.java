Organizations must establish a remote working policy that defines clear security requirements, access controls, and acceptable use conditions for remote environments. The policy should cover both physical and technical safeguards for secure remote operations.

Key measures include:

Assessing and maintaining the physical security of remote workspaces

Requiring secure setups such as lockable storage, secure transport, and clear desk policies

Defining authorized work environments and data access parameters

Securing communications through VPNs, encrypted channels, and virtual desktops

Preventing unauthorized access by non-employees (e.g., family or visitors)

Ensuring home/public networks are securely configured

Using strong authentication and avoiding weak login methods

Restricting use of personal devices unless risk-assessed and approved

Additional provisions should:

Outline acceptable tasks, authorized access, and information handling procedures

Mandate security training for remote users and support teams

Require secure remote communication tools with controls like inactivity timers and location awareness

Cover visitor restrictions, support availability, and equipment insurance

Include backup, continuity, and monitoring processes

Ensure access is revoked and equipment returned when remote work ends

These controls aim to maintain information security even outside the organizationâ€™s physical perimeter.
