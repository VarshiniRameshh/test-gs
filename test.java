Access is managed through MongoDB Atlas roles, with users assigned specific permissions (like read-only, read-write, or admin) at the project level.

Only authorized users from within the GS environment can access Atlas â€” access is enforced via SSO and role mapping.

User provisioning (adding/removing access) is typically handled through the ME portal and approvals from DID owners.
