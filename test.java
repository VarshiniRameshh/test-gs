It’s 01:26 PM IST on Tuesday, July 01, 2025, and I’ll create a formal Confluence draft for MongoDB Atlas with the topics Overview, Design Review, and Connectivity Review, incorporating all provided information (“Key Discussion Points,” your highlights, open questions, extra points, and notes on project creation, API keys, security, inventory, and items for Manjari/Kishor). With “ME” (Monitoring Engineering) recognized as the unified team, the tone will be professional, structured, and aligned with the requested pattern, ensuring clarity and actionable steps. This is ready to paste into Confluence.

MongoDB Atlas
Overview
Purpose
This document provides a formal overview, design assessment, and connectivity evaluation for MongoDB Atlas within Global Systems (GS). Its purpose is to ensure a secure, scalable, and effectively governed environment that meets organizational requirements.
Key Details
	•	Intended Audience: This is directed to the ME team (Monitoring Engineering), Application Teams, Business Units (BUs), the Tech Risk team, and Leadership.
	•	Timeline: Issued on July 01, 2025; feedback is requested by July 08, 2025, 5:00 PM IST; final review scheduled for July 15, 2025.
	•	Objective: To review the current setup, identify improvements, and outline next steps.

	•	Next Steps: The ME team is requested to distribute this draft immediately and compile feedback by the specified deadline.
	•	Collaboration: All teams are encouraged to provide input to refine this document.
Additional Notes
	•	Further details from recent call transcripts are pending and will be incorporated upon receipt.

Design Review
Purpose
This section conducts a thorough evaluation of the architectural design, resource management, security protocols, and future enhancements for MongoDB Atlas.
Key Observations
	•	Organizational Framework: The setup includes 10–12 organizations managed by the ME team, aligned with Business Units, and 160–170 projects functioning as security boundaries. The mapping of Deployment IDs (DIDs) to assets requires clarification.
	•	Resource Management and IaC: Terraform, hosted securely within the GS environment, serves as the primary Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for cluster deployment, supported by mandatory CloudFormation Templates (CFT) for AWS integrations. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) incorporates risk review processes.
	•	Security Measures: PrivateLink secures the data plane, with GS Customer Managed Keys (CMK) and Data Access Control Team (DACT) supporting encryption. However, Key Management Service (KMS) rotation by application teams lacks enforcement.
	•	Multi-Region Strategy: Multi-region deployments are recommended, with port overlap risks addressed through PrivateLink.
	•	Future Enhancements: Atlas Search, offering full-text and vector search capabilities, remains untested and warrants exploration.
	•	Areas for Improvement: Unauthorized cluster creation, unmanaged instances, and undefined control plane policies need attention.

	•	Team Involvement: Application Teams are requested to provide feedback on Search testing by July 15, 2025.
Additional Notes
	•	Initial assumptions regarding ME responsibilities have been clarified; further details are forthcoming.

Connectivity Review
Purpose
This section assesses the network infrastructure, authentication mechanisms, and monitoring connectivity for MongoDB Atlas.
Key Observations
	•	Network Infrastructure: The data plane is protected by PrivateLink, restricting non-GS access, while the control plane offers 99% read-only access and 1–2% privileged access via PACT/DACT. Port overlap risks are managed but require validation.
	•	Authentication Process: API keys, configured as public/private pairs, are managed by the ME team through AWS Secret Manager. The break-glass account, intended for emergency MongoDB support, lacks Identity Provider (IdP) integration.
	•	Inventory and Monitoring: The ME team updates Inventory Central every 2 hours; however, a centralized dashboard is not yet available.
	•	Areas for Improvement: Control plane policies need clarification, cross-realm access requires verification, and the distribution process for API keys remains undefined.

	•	Next Steps: The ME team is requested to confirm policies and set key rotation by July 08, 2025. A consultation with Kishor is planned to address organization count, break-glass setup, SSO/MFA enforcement, CFT mandate, and SDLC controls by July 08, 2025.
	•	Team Involvement: Feedback from all teams will help refine these efforts.
Additional Notes
	•	Clarity on API key types and break-glass management is pending further discussion.

Next Steps
	•	Implementation: Please copy this content into Confluence under the “MongoDB Atlas Governance” page on July 01, 2025.
	•	Distribution: Share with the ME team, Application Teams, BUs, Tech Risk, and Leadership, requesting feedback by July 08, 2025, 5:00 PM IST.
	•	Updates: Incorporate details from call transcripts upon availability.

This draft follows a formal yet approachable pattern, aligning with your request. Paste it into Confluence, distribute it, and share the transcript or Manjari/Kishor feedback for updates. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
