Establish clear procedures and channels for reporting security events promptly.

Ensure all personnel are aware of their responsibility to report incidents, breaches, and vulnerabilities.

Reporting mechanisms must be simple, accessible, and readily available.

Events to report include:

Ineffective security controls

Breach of confidentiality, integrity, or availability

Human errors

Policy or standard violations

Physical security breaches

Unauthorized system changes

System malfunctions or abnormal behaviors

Access violations

Identified vulnerabilities

Suspected malware infections

Personnel should avoid investigating incidents on their own and report them through proper channels.
