1. Design Review vs. Connectivity (Firewall) Review
Design Review:
Higher-level assessment.

Triggered when a system/user wants to use a data platform (e.g., Snowflake, SingleStore).

Focuses on use case, data classification, access pattern, and integration security.

Mostly a self-attestation process (trust-based).

Ensures the design adheres to defined standards before provisioning connectivity.

Connectivity/Firewall Review:
Triggered after design approval when specific users/systems request access.

Actual enforcement point, where access is either granted or blocked.

Requires validation of technical details like source/destination, ports, environments, data classification.

2. Key Validation Points During Firewall Review
Secure Ports:

Only allow secure ports (e.g., Port 443).

Block non-secure ports (e.g., Port 80) unless justified.

Cross-Environment Check:

No cross-environment access (e.g., non-prod â†’ prod).

Validate source (deployment/system) and destination (workspace).

Data Classification Check:

No cross-classification access violations.

For example:

DP-30 to DP-10 (write) is not allowed.

DP-10 reading from DP-30 may be okay.

Data classification should be mapped (via Middlebury engineering's inventory).

User Group Validation:

Validate that users belong to the group/team for whom the workspace was designed (e.g., data engineering).

Question if there's a mismatch (e.g., random teams requesting access).

Number of Users:

Large user base (>25 or >50 users) should raise concern.

Only a handful of developers should have access unless business justification (e.g., Tableau reports for business users).

3. Automation & Documentation
Plan to standardize and document the questions/checks.

Create a template/checklist for:

Design Review Questionnaire

Connectivity/Firewall Approval Checklist

This template will include the above points.

Aim to eventually automate approvals where these conditions are clearly met, reducing manual interventions.

4. Immediate Next Steps
Prepare a document that includes:

Checklist for Design Review (self-attested).

Checklist for Firewall Review (technical validation).

Share with team, including US-based members for urgent firewall approvals.

Use this as a standard reference for reviewing connectivity requests.
