It’s **12:45 PM IST on Thursday, June 26, 2025**, and I’ll create a comprehensive Confluence page draft based on the topics you’ve provided: Resource Management, IaC/SDLC, Network Connectivity to MongoDB Plane, Authentication, Authorization, Encryption, Logging, Monitoring, User Management, Inventory/Data Classification, Multi-Region Deployment, Tenancy, and Atlas Search. I’ll consolidate all relevant content from our prior discussions, including the "Overlapping Port Ranges in Multi-Region Deployments" risk, uploaded documents ("Terraform and CFT Integration," "Access Control and Governance," "Inventory and Monitoring," "Key Discussion Points"), your highlighted concerns, the June 20, 2025, call context (API key rotation and cluster tracking in Inventory Central), and additional points. Since no specific call transcript was provided, I’ll use assumptions based on our prep, leaving placeholders for call-specific details. The draft will be neat, structured, and ready to copy into Confluence.

### Resource Management

#### Overview
Manages allocation and utilization of MongoDB Atlas resources (e.g., clusters, storage).

#### Key Points
- Resources include clusters, VPC endpoints, and API keys, tracked across 10–12 organizations and 160–170 projects (per "Key Discussion Points").
- Budgeting is flexible, not upfront like AWS/GCP.
- **Call Notes (June 20, 2025)**: Discussed resource allocation; awaiting guidelines [Update with transcript].

#### Action Items
| Task            | Responsible Team | Status       |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Define Quotas   | Middleware       | Pending     |
| Monitor Usage   | Application Teams| Pending     |

- Assign middleware to set resource guidelines by July 5, 2025.

---

### IaC/SDLC

#### Overview
Outlines Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) processes.

#### Key Points
- Terraform is the primary IaC tool, hosted in GS, for deploying clusters (per "Terraform and CFT Integration").
- CFT supports AWS dependencies; MongoDB-native CFTs under exploration.
- SDLC includes governance with risk reviews (per "Access Control and Governance").
- **Call Notes (June 20, 2025)**: Reviewed IaC tools; awaiting CFT adoption update [Update with transcript].

#### Action Items
- Document Terraform/CFT setup and SDLC steps.
- Update by June 30, 2025, based on call feedback.

---

### Network Connectivity to MongoDB Plane

#### Overview
Details secure connectivity to MongoDB data and control planes.

#### Key Points
- Data plane uses PrivateLink (ports 1024–65535) for secure traffic; non-GS access blocked (per "Access Control and Governance").
- Control plane access should be secured via network policies (pending confirmation).
- Risk: Overlapping port ranges in multi-region setups can force public endpoints (Medium severity, initial document).
- **Call Notes (June 20, 2025)**: Discussed PrivateLink; verify port management [Update with transcript].

#### Action Items
- List current policies and enforcement methods.
- Assign middleware to confirm port management by July 5, 2025.

---

### Authentication

#### Overview
Covers methods for verifying user and system identities.

#### Key Points
- API keys (public/private pairs) managed via secret manager (per "Terraform and CFT Integration").
- Break-glass account lacks IdP integration (per your extra point).
- **Call Notes (June 20, 2025)**: Reviewed API key rotation; awaiting IdP status [Update with transcript].

#### Action Items
| Task            | Responsible Team | Status       |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Rotate API Keys | Middleware       | Pending     |
| Integrate IdP   | Middleware       | In Progress |

- Confirm rotation schedule and IdP integration by June 30, 2025.

---

### Authorization

#### Overview
Defines access permissions and roles within MongoDB Atlas.

#### Key Points
- RBAC roles (e.g., Organization Owner, Project Creator) control access (web sources).
- GS allowlists restrict API key usage (per "Terraform and CFT Integration").
- Unclear if middleware or ME manages keys.
- **Call Notes (June 20, 2025)**: Clarified roles; awaiting key management details [Update with transcript].

#### Action Items
| Role          | Task                  | Team           |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Key Management| Manage API Keys      | [TBD]         |

- Update roles chart by June 30, 2025.

---

### Encryption

#### Overview
Ensures data protection at rest and in transit.

#### Key Points
- PrivateLink ensures encrypted data plane traffic (per "Access Control and Governance").

- **Call Notes (June 20, 2025)**: Verify encryption standards [Update with transcript].

#### Action Items
- Document encryption policies.
- Assign middleware to confirm settings by July 5, 2025.

---

### Logging

#### Overview
Tracks activities and events for auditing and troubleshooting.

#### Key Points

---

### User Management

#### Overview
Manages user accounts and access levels.

#### Key Points
- Middleware sets up organizations; application teams manage users (per "Key Discussion Points").
- Break-glass account needs IdP integration.
- **Call Notes (June 20, 2025)**: Reviewed user setup [Update with transcript].

#### Action Items
| Task            | Responsible Team | Status       |
