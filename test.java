Organizations must plan to maintain information security during disruptions by:

Identifying and including information security requirements in business continuity plans.
Developing and testing plans to maintain or restore security of critical business information.
Maintaining existing security controls or applying compensating controls when original ones can't be upheld.
Ensuring restoration of information security to the required level and within defined timeframes.
This ensures protection, continuity, and resilience of information assets during interruptions.
