MongoDB Atlas provides built-in tools to monitor the performance, health, and resource usage of database clusters.

Application teams rely on MongoDB Atlas dashboards for real-time insights like CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, and slow queries.

Alerts can be configured per project to notify teams about issues (e.g., high latency, replica set lag, low disk space).

Monitoring data is project-specific and not aggregated centrally at the organization level.

Middleware Engineering may review performance as part of support or operational reviews but does not manage day-to-day monitoring.
