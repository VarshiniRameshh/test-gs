Organizations must ensure that records are protected to meet legal, regulatory, contractual, and business requirements while maintaining their availability, confidentiality, integrity, and usability.

Clear procedures should be established for storage, custody, and authorized destruction of records, aligned with retention schedules based on business and legal needs. Records must be identifiable by type, classification, and retention period.

Both physical and electronic records should be stored securely, with accessibility maintained throughout their lifecycle. Records must be retrievable in required formats and within expected timeframes. Electronic records should be safeguarded from media failure or obsolescence using technologies like encryption and digital signatures to ensure authenticity and long-term access.
