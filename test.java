### **Summary for A.6.1 – Screening**

* Ensure checks are proportional to business needs, role criticality, and data access risks.
* Include:

  * Satisfactory references (business/personal)
  * Verification of CV completeness and accuracy
  * Confirmation of academic/professional qualifications
  * Independent identity verification (e.g. passport)
  * Further checks (credit or criminal) if role is critical
* Define criteria, eligibility, frequency, and limitations for verification reviews.
