Organizations must identify, document, and comply with all legal, statutory, regulatory, and contractual information security requirements. This includes:

Integrating legal obligations during policy development, control design, and risk assessments.

Regularly reviewing applicable laws across jurisdictions where the organization operates or transfers data.

Ensuring compliance with cryptography-related regulations (e.g., import/export restrictions, encryption usage, digital signatures).

Addressing information security clauses in client, supplier, and insurance contracts.

Legal advice is recommended when handling sensitive areas like encryption across borders.
